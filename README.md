PKBASIC
=======

PKBasic is my own flavor of BASIC.
It's minimalistic, strongly-typed, and interpreted.

COMPILING
=======

requirements:
* c++ standard library.

_Builds tested using clang++ and g++ on OSX and ubuntu 10.04, respectively_
_untested on windows_

INSTALLATION
============

Installation is simple, just run installer.py in the root directory of the project.
If you need to edit the build configuration, edit the config files in /build.

Alternatively, copy and paste this into your terminal:
```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quadnix/PKBASIC/master/misc/install.sh | sh```

LICENSING
