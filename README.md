PKBasic
=======

PKBasic is my own flavor of BASIC.
It's minimalistic, strongly-typed, and interpreted.

COMPILING
=======

requirements:
* c++ standard library.

_Builds tested using clang++ and g++ on OSX and ubuntu 10.04, respectively_

INSTALLATION
============

Installation is simple, just run installer.py in the root directory of the project.
If you need to edit the build configuration, edit the config files in /build.

WIKI
====

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/quadnix/PKBasic/wiki) for information on how to use the language

LICENSING
=========
