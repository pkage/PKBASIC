this is a note on how extensions work

 - on main load
extensions are registered in main
extensions will be called whenever necessary - will have access to variables

 - on call
variables are written to file by main
processed in function in headerfile*
library (written in C++ or whatever) processes it (and is passed invokation by arg) and generates a tiny modifier script
	modifier scripts solely contain variables: meant to modify the environment
